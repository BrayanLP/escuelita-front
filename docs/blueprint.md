## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A muted, professional blue (#5A79A7). This color evokes trust, knowledge, and dependability which are well aligned to a platform for online courses.
- Background color: A very light grey (#F0F2F5). This nearly-white color is visually restful and helps create a clean, uncluttered design.
- Accent color: A subdued teal (#63B598), providing a complementary contrast to the blue without being jarring. This will provide a touch of uniqueness and guide the user to calls to action.
- Body text: 'Inter' sans-serif, for body text; this will pair well with other typefaces for headlines.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' sans-serif for headlines. It will lend the app a slightly modern and technical feel without sacrificing readability.
- Use consistent, clear icons from a set like FontAwesome or Material Icons to represent course categories, user actions, and navigational elements. Favor outlined icons for a modern feel.
- Employ a grid-based layout system for a structured and responsive design. Ensure consistent spacing and alignment throughout the platform. Use white space effectively to separate content and create visual breathing room.
